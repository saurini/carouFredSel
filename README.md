carouFredSel
===========

caroFredSel is an excellent jQuery plugin with a diverse set of options which are fairly straightforward and easy to 
change. There's already a paid version available from the Wordpress Community, but mine aims to be simpler without
automagical integration with outside feeds like Flicker ( for now ).

Installation
-----
Until this plugin is feature complete, I won't be putting it on the Wordpress Community Plugins page. For now, you can 
simply do a pull request into the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.

Todo's
----
* This plugin needs to be genericized.
* Possible live editing of the slide so that the output can be previewed before saving.
* Need to add shortcodes.
* Need the ability to have multiple carousels.
* Various UI improvements
